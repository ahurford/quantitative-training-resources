# Computer use policies for Biology
- Instructors may ask students to use their personal laptops in class, but cannot require computer exercises unless all students that wish to use a university-sourced computer have one made available to them.
- Instructors cannot recommend that two students share a computer that is the property of one student. 
- Drinks are not permitted around computers, and if a computer is damaged during a class, the instructor is not liable. 

## Observations
- Casual surveys suggest 5-10% of students will need to use university-source computers.
- When university-sourced computers are available most students will opt to use them.
- Biology computer labs need to be available on a drop-in basis and for longer hours.
- If students are asked to bring their own laptops for a biology lab, finding a space can be difficult due to lack of electrical outlets and the unavailability of the same classroom across a 3 hour block. The best option is, that if there are no safety issues, to use the biology labs.
