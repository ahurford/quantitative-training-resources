# Computer use policies for biology
- Instructors may ask students to use their personal laptops in class, but cannot require computer exercises unless all students that wish to use a university-sourced computer have one made available to them.
- Instructors cannot recommend that two students share a computer that is the property of one student. 
- Drinks are not permitted around computers, and if a computer is damaged during a class, the instructor is not liable. 

## Observations
- Casual surveys suggest 5-10% of students will need to use university-sourced computers.
- When university-sourced computers are available most students will opt to use them, possibly because it is inconvenient to bring a laptop.
- Biology computer labs need to be available on a drop-in basis and for longer hours.
- If students are asked to bring their own laptops for a biology lab, finding a space can be difficult due to lack of electrical outlets and the unavailability of the same classroom across a 3 hour block. The best option is, that if there are no safety issues, to use the biology labs. While we do, in some instances, ask students to bring their own laptops, currently we don't have infrastructure or policy to support this practice.
- Computer labs, when drop-in is available, can be a good source of community building for undergraduates.
