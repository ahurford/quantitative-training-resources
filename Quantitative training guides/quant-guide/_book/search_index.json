There are several reasonable options for data entry, for example: Spreadsheet Text file Database Form (web or GUI databases). In R, you can also input data directly, which can be the right choice if you are working with a small dataset. Here, you will learn how to enter the data from your experiments and save them using R. Let’s start by making table 1 for your report, which we will call solution-concentration-effect-on-potato.csv: table1 &lt;- data.frame(weight = c(&quot;initial&quot;, &quot;final&quot;, &quot;difference&quot;, &quot;percent-change&quot;), &quot;NaCl-0-percent&quot; = c(NA, NA, NA, NA), &quot;NaCl-0.9-percent&quot; = c(NA, NA, NA, NA), &quot;NaCl-2-percent&quot; = c(NA, NA, NA, NA), &quot;NaCl-5-percent&quot; = c(NA, NA, NA, NA)) write.csv(x = table1, file = &quot;solution-concentration-effect-on-potato.csv&quot;, row.names = FALSE) In the above code, make sure to replace the NA’s with the values from your experiment. Keep in mind that the values entered into the tables should be decimals greater than or equal to zero, and likely less than 100 since you measured mass in grams and the potato cubes for the experiments were 8 cm3 in size. Notice that we used the file extension “.csv”. CSV stands for comma-separated values, which is a format for tabular data stored in a text file where a comma separates the columns of the data. That is why a comma separates each of the values in the rows for the different solutions. Now, we will make table 2, which includes the class averages and we will call solution-concentration-effect-on-potato-averages.csv: table2 &lt;- data.frame(weight = c(&quot;percent-change&quot;, &quot;minimum-value&quot;, &quot;maximum-value&quot;, &quot;difference&quot;), &quot;NaCl-0-percent&quot; = c(NA, NA, NA, NA), &quot;NaCl-0.9-percent&quot; = c(NA, NA, NA, NA), &quot;NaCl-2-percent&quot; = c(NA, NA, NA, NA), &quot;NaCl-5-percent&quot; = c(NA, NA, NA, NA)) write.csv(x = table1, file = &quot;solution-concentration-effect-on-potato-averages.csv&quot;, row.names = FALSE) We can load our our data files in CSV format into R using the function read.csv in the following way: data1 &lt;- read.csv(file = &quot;solution-concentration-effect-on-potato.csv&quot;) data2 &lt;- read.csv(file = &quot;solution-concentration-effect-on-potato-averages.csv&quot;) Here, the argument file = of read.csv is the name of the file we want to read. Notice that the filename needs to be a character string, so we put it in quotes. To take a look at our data, we can print then by typing the name and hitting Enter (or Return). data1 ## weight NaCl.0.percent NaCl.0.9.percent NaCl.2.percent NaCl.5.percent ## 1 initial NA NA NA NA ## 2 final NA NA NA NA ## 3 difference NA NA NA NA ## 4 percent-change NA NA NA NA data2 ## weight NaCl.0.percent NaCl.0.9.percent NaCl.2.percent NaCl.5.percent ## 1 initial NA NA NA NA ## 2 final NA NA NA NA ## 3 difference NA NA NA NA ## 4 percent-change NA NA NA NA "]
