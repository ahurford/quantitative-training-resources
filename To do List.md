Meeting with Yolanda Jan 30, 2020:

Outline for new lab:
1. Intro to R
1. Entering data exercise. Identify relevant data. Data should be discrete with at least 3 groups. Export from R as .csv, write metadata. Submit to dropbox. 
1. Plot data to replicate a bar chart. Replot as box plot. Save in .pdf or related format.
1. Practice writing hypothesis, prediction, and equation (i.e., equation is means of groups not equal in notation).
1. Repeat plotting for data with continuous independent variable.
1. Practice writing equation for data with continuous independent variable.

Each of these 6 sub-components should be planned for ~30 mins.

Current work

Amy - will try to improve on directives for others.

Joany - currently working on the quantitative training manual. The manual needs a bit of reorganizing. Irrelevant files need to be deleted. Do we have anything written about metadata? Also, format the Brightspace data repository. Talk to Amy about how to do this. New .docx file added which is an outline for the new lab. Yolanda has instructions wrt to datafile. Also, this .docx file needs to be converted into .Rmd to add it to the quant training manual.

Yolanda - is taking a start on finding data for new lab. Also would like to pilot the training manual for class, so finishing this might need to take more of a priority.

Shawn - was going to write about how to do predictions as equations.

-----------
Current work as of Jan 9, 2020:

Joany - Start working on a section in the quant guide regarding how to save data as a .csv, i.e., based on what is written under Tables here https://github.com/ahurford/quantitative-training-resources/blob/master/Labs/1001/1001.md.

Yolanda - On Thursday mornings is editing the first-year-guide in bookdown. Next will be uploading data into R and getting help.

Shawn - Thursday lunchtime work on the new first year lab, specifically, instructions/exercises about writing hypotheses as equations.

Amy - work on providing clearer guidelines on what we are doing in this Github and the private one, and better organize the files.

----------
Quant Work Plan (based on Dec. 17, 2019 meeting)

To do’s:

-	Produce video “orientation to R”. Also make accomponying text materials (Joany)
-	Develop code/lab materials to go with osmosis lab (BIOL 1001 - Joany)
-	Develop code/lab materials to go with yeast lab (BIOL 1001)
-	Develop a lab/video content for data visualization “lab” exercise.

On the shelf
------
-	2nd year course proposal? (“Concepts and practices in Biology”/”Concepts and tools/skills in Biology”)
-	Flesh out learning outcomes document
-	Department Vision/Goals/Talking points
-	What’s in the parking lot (for courses?) BIOL 4306 Applied Biology – is an examination of how biological and other sciences are applied to the problems of management and utilization of organisms at both the individual and system level to meet human needs.
