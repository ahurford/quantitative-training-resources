I got stumped on figuring out what quantiative skills were, so I jotted down some brainstorming on the topic:
1. Reading graphs. This could include reading a phylogeny.
1. knowing the equation for a straight line in non-conventional notation
1. Being able to sketch graphs
1. Respecting notation, i.e. don't define f(N1) = N1 and f(N2) = N2^2. If f(N1) = N1, then f(N2) = N2, and to avoid this a new function must be defined: g(x) = x^2, such that g(N2) = N2^2.
1. Words -> Graph -> Equation (Lab 2)
1. Units (Parameter table).
1. What is a quantity: name, symbol, units, procedural statment (how measured), typical values. Scientists use quantities.
1. Agency - notation
1. Exercise: find the units
1. Agency in model type: If you predict something increases, and the predictor variable is continuous, the default model is linear, but you can choose the model associated with your prediction.
1. Assess whether your model is good by visual inspection of the residuals.
1. Type I and type II errors, in response to moving away from alpha = 0.05.
1. Choosing the right type of graph for your data / data visualization.
1. How to sell 'boring' stuff?
1. Log scales.
1. Integration.
1. Error propagation and error estimates.
