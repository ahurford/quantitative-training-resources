Goals:
- Identify where in the circulum modules to achieve quantitative goals can be incorporated (i.e. which courses/instructors would support the initiative).
- Summarize what is currently being done to build better connections across courses.
- What do the faculty view as the areas that need improvement.

5. Quantitative skills you teach, but think should be taught in other courses earlier in the curriculum.

6. What is your view of STAT 2550:
a. STAT 2550 is sufficient
b. STAT 2550 is sufficient, if augmented with regular use of statistics in other biology courses
c. A BIOL stats course needs to be developed to replace STAT 2550.
