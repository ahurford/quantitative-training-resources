# Introduction
Quantitative skills are important in biology. Quantitative skills include performing statistical analyses, using computer software to manage and reformat data, designing experiments, understanding graphs, vizualizing data, identifying genes from DNA sequences, and making phylogenies. Many of these tasks are now performed using computers, and elements of computer programming, statistics, and applied mathematics can be useful for professional biologists. Quantitative skills are being incorporated throughout the biology major.
