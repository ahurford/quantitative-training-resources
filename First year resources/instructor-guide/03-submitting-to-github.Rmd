#Submitting to Github

Here are some instructions for submitting to `github`: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VC9pCMuvfU&t=28s

These instructions to provide advice on how to suggest revisions to a repository when you are not a collabotor or the owner. Many of the resources that I found on the internet assumed that you wished to submit to your own repository, not someone else's. You will need a `github` account to use this approach. If you do not wish to use this approach just email me your changes (<ahurford@mun.ca>)
