I am willing to help you with any problems you are having with the quantitative training modules for biology (ahurford@mun.ca). I can stop by your office to help you on your computer or you can stop by my office with your laptop. The first step is to download R and RStudio following the instructions provided also to the students. As of 2017, 58% of publications in ecology mention the use of R and useage has increased linearly at a rate of 5.8% per year since 2008 (citation). R is free. While Excel may feel familiar and easier, R has so much more power: I am writing this very document in R using a package that I installed for typesetting. I can use R to draw a map, or build a phylogeny, if I just install the right packages. R is a scripting language, but even the scripting component can be made easier by installing packages to reduce the scripting component until you build your confidence. In solidarity, I did not learn to code, or learn R, in a class either. I learned out of necessity during graduate studies, from my peers, or from the internet. So many of us have, and that is why we are now trying to provide the support, through teaching, that our next of biologists needs. I have no hidden tricks, all of my best advice is available in resources provided to our students. However, managing archived data using Github and editing these bookdown documents are instructor-specific task and the instructions to do so are provided on this site. "],
["bookdown.html", "Chapter 2 bookdown", " Chapter 2 bookdown bookdown is an R package for typesetting. It allows use to produce .html files, ebooks, and .pdf files all with one click. See here for a book explaining how to use bookdown: https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/ These files are my first attempts at using bookdown and Iâ€™ve just been downloading the example files and editing: there may be some obselete text and files. To produce a .pdf using bookdown requires a latex installation and the book cited above provides recommendations regarding specific details. Each chapter is an R Markdown file. You can recommend edits on a chapter by just editing the .Rmd file if that is easier for you. You can also provide recommendations without needing to use R at all. Just open the relevant .Rmd file in MS Word or a text editor (i.e., TextEdit on Mac OSX), and make simple edits (i.e., no inserting figures, links, no bulleted lists, etc). You can email your revisions to me (ahurford@mun.ca) or submit your changes to the Github site associated with this book. "]
