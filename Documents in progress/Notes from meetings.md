1. DS: Need to meet with first year instructors to learn content of BIOL 1001 and 1002.
1. DS: Need to survey faculty as to what quantitative skills they use in upper level courses, and if start towards developing these skills can or should be incorporated into first year.
1. DS: Need to survey first year students to identify what attracts them to the program (biology) or a program that requires 1001. Important regarding student recruitment to the program/courses. Some students may be attracted to biology because it is not quantitative.
1. BIOS/ugrads are keen to offer input.
1. PT and DS suggest MS Excel should be utilized as an option. A 'soft' roll-out could be adopted to assess likely receptiveness to mandatory software requirements, i.e., R.
1. PT: 1001/1002 is already 'full' good content cut.
1. SG: There are good excercises in the 1001/1002 textbook.
1. JR: Skills in Botany/Evolution - reading phylogenies, being able to identify equivalent phylogenies.
1. DQ: 'Relative tables' terminology around data scinece
1. DQ: 2-day carpentary workshops could be offered/support curiculuum.
1. DQ: Has resources around date entry/archiving.

Thanks to everyone that attended! Please add anything that is omitted.

BIOL 1001/1002 lecture
- SA: In UK, exposed to stats in first year.

Entering data
- DQ: Excel is fine to use, but make it clear that its strength is data entry and analysis might best be performed elsewhere.
- LPC: Preferred format is tabular. Need to follow-up on the rationale.

Softwares
- SL+: Government scientists are using Excel for analysis so we should keep future careers of our students in mind.
- EG, AR etc: Discussed covering same topics in R and Python to communicate the programming skills are transferrable, but eventually concluded to that this could be an advanced topic outsourced to CS or Bioinformatics.
- DQ: Science should be reproducibile and Excel analaysis are not reproducible because it isn't a scripting language.

Second year course: Datacarpentary for biologists
- LPC: Related courses are offered in CS covering Intro to Data Analysis/Intro to programming, or a course could be developed as a service course.
- YW: Remove that this should be a 'required' course. This will facilitate getting the course 'up and running'. In addition, what courses we require for out major is a topic that requires separate consideration and it's best to separate these issues.

Support
- YW: CITL is a resource to help with the production of teaching videos.

Overall, there seems to be overwhelming support for the simple steps that we wish to implement in the first year lab.
