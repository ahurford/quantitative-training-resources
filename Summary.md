This summary covers activities through the end of the Jan 8, 2019.

During this time I have had meetings with BUGS (2), Dave Schniedier, Danielle Quinn, an EcoEvo meeting open to all members of the department, Ed Whalen, Yolanda, Eric, Shawn, as well as email exchanges or brief communication with Dawn Bignell, Kapil Tahlan, Andrew Lang, Lourdes Pena-Castillo, Piotr Trela, Margret Caldwell, Sally Goodard, Hope Bennett, Valerie Power, and Fiona Cuthbert.

My initial thoughts are shaped by Hampton et al. 2017, which I highly recommend (https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/67/6/546/3784601).

The revision of the biology curiculuum with respect to quantitative training should have two objectives:
1. Quantitative literacy. Students should be comfortable reading and evaluating papers with quantitaitve methods appropriate to their steam/specialization (for example, statistical analyses, mathematical models, large data sets, graphs, computer code). Skills could include those listed in Table 2 of Hampton et al. 2017.
2. Develop students' confidence in handling and interpreting data. At minimmum, upon completing our BSc program (or potentially only specific streams of our program), if a student were given data and some context, the student can apply their biological knowledge to form a hypothesis, and make some progress on assessing whether the data support their hypothesis using statistics and/or data visualization.

See document: "Draft quantiative learning goals" for detailed learning goals and objectives at each level (document in progress - currently not super readable): https://github.com/ahurford/quantitative-training-resources/blob/master/Documents%20in%20progress/Draft%20Quantitative%20Learning%20Goals.pdf. In addition, I emailed Carissa Brown to request a copy of geography's quantitative training document at the request of Eric Vanderwal, but have not received a reply. Competency E1 on p22 of Scientific Foundations for Future Physicians (https://store.aamc.org/scientific-foundations-for-future-physicians-pdf.html) has some good comments.

### Publically available as an ebook
A Quantitative training in biology manual will be developed and available as an online resource that is publically available and hosted on Gitlab. Courses can provide the link to the ebook on brightspace. It is essential that the quant materials are available digitially so that we can link to existing online resources such as the carpentaries, ebooks, and where to download software (i.e., R/RStudio).

Existing lab manuals will be retained in their current hardcopy form, but will be edited to reference links to material available online.

## BIOL 1001/1002
Biology 1001 and 1002 lectures seems tightly focused around Campbell Biology, and as such, there is limited opportunity to deviate from the textbook. This was the feedback given from Sally, Piotr, and Margaret. We note that there are nice quantiative exercises contained within Campbell Biology.

## BIOL 1001
Changes to BIOL 1001 are targetted for Fall 2020, specific materials being developed will be in the Labs folder, and the quant-training-guide.

## BIOL 1002
The new requirements for 1001 will be continued into 1002 for implementation in Winter 2021. Specific labs with quantitative components are:

'Laboratory 2 - Transpiration' (currently hypothesis, table, graph required)

'Laboratory 5 - Daphnia' (currently, hypothesis, table graph required)

'Laboratory 6 - Countercurrent exchange' (currently, hypothesis, table graph required)

'Laboratory 8 - Organisms response to environmental conditions' (currently, hypothesis, table graph required)

## A 2000-level "Datacarpentary in Biology"
Initially, I had wanted to recommend a new second year course: "Datacarpentary in Biology", "Handling biological data","Tools and techniques in biology" or "Concepts and Principles in Biology". The course could draw on materials from here: https://datacarpentry.org/semester-biology/schedule/ (which has a github repository and I emailed Ethan White and he is more than okay with use borrow and modifying his materials). The linked course is a graduate-level course and so the idea is to spread the content across 13 weeks to resuls in a course appropriate for the 2000-level. A course proposal was drafted here: https://github.com/ahurford/quantitative-training-resources/blob/master/Documents%20in%20progress/2020%20%20New%20Course%20Proposal%20Biol%202XXX%20Data%20skills%20for%20Biologists.docx

Each week the documentataion and exercises could be based around a different second year required course, i.e. Week 1: Data entry and storage use examples from Cell Biology; Week 2 Intro to R uses examples based from Ecology; and so forth for Genetics, Evolution and Physiology. This would also open up the possibility to pilot these labs at the second year level if instructors are willing and while the proposed course is undergoing university approval.

The idea to propose a basic R programming and quantitative literacy course for biologists at the second year was shelved following the meeting with Yolanda, Eric, and Shawn on December 17 for the following reasons:

- I am concerned that Lourdes feels that we should instead require a CS course on general programming. I see Lourdes as a key component of our quantitative training going forward.

- The Dean of Science does not want courses that duplicate resources

- Teaching faculty are a scarce resource: whoever teaches this second year course then becomes unavailable at the third and fourth year level

- 2000- is the appropriate level for such a course, and the course it needed, but currently the second year course requirements for the biology major are very heavy, and so it is not possible to add this course (or any course) without a broader discussion of our curiculuum.

Having shelfed this idea, currently we plan to develop labs for second year to develop related skills. This will begin once the materials for 1001 and 1002 have been completed. At least one quantitative lab should be introduced into second year courses. This would be at least 5 labs, and the work would be at least equivalent to 1/2 a teaching credit. We should consider how we can enable a faculty member to have the time to develop these labs. In addition, if we are to work within the scope of existing courses, there needs to be support from leadership in the department, both in terms of identifying quantitative training as a priority for our department (so that individual instructors know to support the quantitative training initiative).

## Recommendations for BIOL 2000-level courses and beyond
We will maintain resources and guidelines to help with quantitative content in 2000- and above courses. Resources could include ready-made activities and exercises for use in lecture and/or lab, as well as training/workshops for faculty and lab instructors/TAs. 

Some recommendations for learning outcomes are (need to revise https://github.com/ahurford/quantitative-training-resources/blob/master/Draft%20Quantitative%20Learning%20Goals.pdf to cover these):

1. Discuss Type I and Type II errors (Type I: alarm, no fire; Type II: fire, no alarm). The statement from American Statistical Association advocating the downfall of alpha = 0.05, if I understand DS correctly, should now be replaced with a discussion of the types of questions where lower or higher acceptable Type II errors are appropriate, for example, a fire with no alarm is a life and death matter; if my oven timer doesn't go off, then dinner will get burnt which is much less serious and as such a higher Type II error is acceptible for the latter. (I need to read and consult further on this point).

1. Increase awareness about the importance of sampling design and the implications of different sampling approaches (random, haphazarad, stratified random) on analyses and inference. This could be done in lectures through illustrating concepts with figure and images from real-world reserarch papers (if your own, even better) and through simple lab exericses that have students sample from a population and analyse the data. 

1. Increase awareness about the imporance of experimental design and how decisions about experimental design affect which statistical tests are appropriate. Some of this may overlap concepts taughts in STAT 2550 (AH edit: I'm not sure this is covered here), but illustrting these with Biology examples will increase undertanding. Key concepts related to experimental design that students should be comfortable with at the end of the 2000-level courses include: treatment/control, sampling replicates vs. experimental replicate (some areas of biology term these technical replicate vs. biological replication), pseudoreplication, block design, randomized block design.

1. All graphs should be accompanied by their formulas and in non-conventional notation, if appropriate, to encourage better familiarity with the shapes of functions and non-conventional notational. 

1. To build confidence with writing equations, we might also talk about units (really the only way an equation can go wrong) and give guidelines for notation choices (see links.md for recent paper on this).

1. We need to be consistently reporting the spread of data and discussing overlap with respect to Type II error.

1. ggplot and RStudio. Personally, I don't use ggplot, but https://stat545.com/index.html makes a compelling argument for it and all the software/data carpentries and other prepackaged materials are in ggplot and dplyr.

## Continuity
With the quant training manual avialable as an ebook (and publically available), instructors in upper level courses and STAT 2550 should be knowledgeable of what is taught in first year and be knowledgable as to if what they are recommending conflicts. 

## STAT 2550

Hampton et al. (https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/67/6/546/3784601) states that "we recommend a computational approach to statistics training". Therefore, we need to consult with the Statistics department to determine if STAT 2550 is meeting our needs and to facilitate better integration STAT 2550 and our program. At BUGS, there was support for replacing STAT 2550 with an in-house version, but this would present staffing challenges. It was noted that psychology does not require STAT 2550 and instead teaches their own course. Might we consider requiring that pyschology course instead of STAT 2550 if we truly want to bring STAT 2550 in house?

It is also important to touch on 1) the statement from that ASA about alpha = 0.05; and 2) data visualization as discussed here (https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002128).

## BIOL 4605 and graduate courses
This course from UBC seems very good: https://stat545.com/index.html. Amy has also archieved all of Dave Schneiders BIOL 4605 materials from Fall 2019.

## The curriculuum
The current required courses are (see https://www.mun.ca/regoff/calendar/sectionNo=SCI-0736):

BIOC 2201 Intro to Biochemistry

BIOC 3206 Metabolism

CHEM 1050 General Chemistry 1 (3h lab/wk)

CHEM 1051 General Chemistry 2 (3h lab/wk)

CHEM 2400 Organic Chemistry 1 (3h lab/wk)

CHEM 2401 Organic Chemistry 2 (3h lab/week)

Six (6) credit hours in Critical Reading and Writing (CRW) courses, including at least 3 credit hours in English courses.

MATH 1000 Calculus 1

PHYS 1020 Intro physics 1 (6 x 3hr lab/semester)

PHYS 1021 (or 1050 and 1051) Intro physics 2 (6 x 3hr lab/semester)

STAT 2550 Statistics for Science Students (90 min lab/wk)

BIOL 1001 Principles of Biology I (3h lab/week)

BIOL 1002 Principles of Biology II (3h lab/week)

BIOL 2060 Prinicples of Cell Biology (3h lab/week)

BIOL 2250 Principles of Genetics (3h lab/week)

BIOL 2600 Prinicples of Ecology (3h lab/week)

BIOL 2900 Principles of Evolution and Systematics (3h lab/week)

one of BIOL 3401 Comparative Animal Physiology, 3402 Plant physiology, 4245 Biophysics and 4404 Microbial physiology. (3h lab/week)

If the faculty divide into two groups, I'd expect that the courses each group would fight for are:

Cell and Molecular: BIOL 2060, physiology, 2 organic chemistries, 2 biochemistries (6 total courses + 4 labs = 30 hr/wk)

Ecology and Evolution: BIOL 2600, 2900, MATH 1001, STAT 2550 (4 total courses + 2.5 labs = 19.5 hr/wk)

The remaining reqirements are probably supported by all.

Leading suggestions are eliminating the requirement of Organic Chem 2 and making the course requirments stream specific (As discussed at the Sept. 20 and Nov 7, 2019 BUGS meetings). 

I choose three other Canadian universities for a quick comparison:

- Dalhousie BSc in Biology: lighter load of required courses by requiring only 2 semesters of CHEM, no BIOCHEM, and no PHYS: https://www.dal.ca/faculty/science/biology/undergraduate/majors-and-minors/major-in-biology.html

- Simon Fraser BSc in Biology: appears to have a similar load of required courses as compared to us  http://www.sfu.ca/students/calendar/2020/spring/programs/biological-sciences/major/bachelor-of-science.html

- University of Alberta: Difficult to compare as Cell and Molecular Biology appears to be separated from Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Scinece.

## Computing and software requirements
We should develop a policy on our expectations (i.e., are undergrads expected to have access to a personal computer, and if so, what minimum specs) and quantify demand for departmental computing resources. See https://github.com/ahurford/quantitative-training-resources/blob/master/Computer%20policies.md

## Teaching communication and collaboration
Both Vision and Change and Hampton et al. 2017, highlight communication skills as a key aspect of data science training. YW has mentioned an interest in this area. To my understanding, the references are not so much referring to social media or giving talks, but how to communicate to participate in interdisciplinary collaborations. (YW: My communications module in BIOL 4651 (6-9 hours of the semester) focuses on general principles of good communication and practical examples of to effectively communicate science to different audiences (e.g., government/decision makers, fellow scientists, K-12 students, general public) and with different formats (written, oral, visual). This could be modified to focus explicitly on communicating quantiative material to diverse audiences). 

## Streams
We need to work on tightening up our streams as recommended in the AUP, including the Quantitative/field stream.

## Modelling
Vision and Change highlights the importance of modelling. So far, my recommendations focus mainly around stats and data science.
